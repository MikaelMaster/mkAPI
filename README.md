# mkAPI - NO MORE UPDATES! (Now I'm using mkUtils for Minecraft version *1.17--recent*, and mkUtilsLegacy for Minecraft version 1.8_R3.)
 API to develop plugins for Spigot and Bungee using the Kotlin as main language.
 You can see my NEW APIs for Minecraft development here:
 * https://github.com/MikaelMaster/mkUtils (for Minecraft version 1.17--recent)
 * https://github.com/MikaelMaster/mkUtilsLegacy (for Minecraft version 1.8_R3)
 
Both APIs above are still receiving updates! (mkUtils AND mkUtilsLegcy!)
